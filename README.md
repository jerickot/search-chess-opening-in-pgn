This project's goal is to provide code that can be used to search through files which
have chess games in algebraic notation stored in them(like they can be obtained by
for example lichess.org). Ultimately you should be able to take the algebraic notation of a chess game until a certain move and the file which has chess games stored in it and let the program tell you which of these games have exactly the opening moves that you specified.
